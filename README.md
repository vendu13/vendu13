# 👋 Hi, I’m Shivendu

🚀 I build rapid prototypes and MVPs using the power of AI.

I'm passionate about turning ideas into functional products — fast. Whether it's leveraging LLMs to automate workflows, crafting proof-of-concepts for web apps, or integrating AI APIs to solve real-world problems, I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity.
